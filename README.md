# Ruinology
This is a prototype attempt for Ludum Dare 36.

Lost in an ancient maze, get out before it collapses!

This will be an unofficial attempt for LD 36. 

I may or may not finish within the 72-hour jam and might continue to finish it on my own.

# Mechanics
The programming is done in Java.

The rooms are randomly generated, and you start in a random place on the maze.

You have no weapons, get as much treasure as you can, and find the exit before the maze destroys you.
