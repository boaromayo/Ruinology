Ruinology
==========
This is a game originally intended as an entry for [Ludum Dare 36][ld36], now an experimental app to test random procedural generation.

Lost in an ancient maze, get out before it collapses!

Details
-------
- Rooms are randomly generated, ranging from an 4x4 to 8x8 set of rooms (this may be subject to change). For the prototype version, I plan on doing just the default 6x6 sized maze.
- Items are also randomly scattered in each room.

- No weapons.
- Get a lot of treasure for a higher score.
- Find the exit before the maze destroys you.
